<h1>What it is ???</h1>
It is an online book store, created with ReactJS, Redux, using semanticui.
Work is still in progress.....I am going to add gignup, login form, validation, authentication

<h1>Why???</h1>
I just decided to learn Redux and one of the best things to learn anything is to practise, so decided to make a simple project 
I did not care about the beaty, my main focus was ReactJS + Redux.
JSON file has more than 500 books so you can play around by sorting by low price, hight price, author, search etc


you can clone https://github.com/YKalashnikov/Book-store-using-ReactJS-Redux-Semanticui.git

cd ...
yarn install
yarn start
